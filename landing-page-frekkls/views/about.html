      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <div class="h-line"></div>
      <p class="container fr-column"> Before Frekkls was founded both, Daniel and Wolfgang the founders of Frekkls, worked in startups that tackled the challenge of curating products to people. While Daniel worked with an influencer marketing approach, creating personalized fashion items for niche audiences making influencer marketing accessible for the ‚Äúlong-tail influencers‚Äù, Wolfgang helped building the successful german startup Outfittery which matches customers with the right clothing pieces by providing everyone with a real personal stylist. It became very clear that real human connection is still key when it comes to selling products especially in times of online mass-sales with tremendously broad assortments where the shopping experience tends to be anonymous, cold and unguided. When Wolfgang and Daniel met both faced identical issues: e-commerce performs quite poorly for the effort you have to put into it. It‚Äôs not engaging for customers and the navigation through the massive supply is boring. It‚Äôs lacking the human connection, guidance and true inspiration. While some startups try to disrupt this trend with automated showcase, AI and chat bots the two believe that online shopping is missing only one thing: People. And so they founded Frekkls in late 2017, a startup which mission is to ‚Äúhumanize‚Äù e-commerce by decentralizing the power of motivated selling to individuals with passion for products in a scalable way.</p>
