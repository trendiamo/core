<p class="description">​The Firewire Timbertek Greedy Beaver surfboard. The Greedy Beaver looks like a longboard, has all the benefits that a longboard brings but it’s a shortboard in spirit. It’s got the wave catching ability and the glide of a log but has the manoeuvrability you associate with a shortboard. You can put it on a rail and surf it off the tail and it comes to life like you can't believe, tight turns and pocket surfing are a reality on a board which looks like a longboard.</p>
