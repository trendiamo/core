### 1. Introduction

Welcome to UPTOUS!

These terms and conditions of use govern your use of UPTOUS and provide information about the UPTOUS service, outlined below. When you create an UPTOUS account or use UPTOUS, you agree to those terms.

The UPTOUS platform is one of Trendiamo Unipessoal Lda.’s products. These terms and conditions of use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Trendiamo Unipessoal Lda.

2.3 You may not sue the Service and may not accept the Terms if (i) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with UPTOUS, or (ii) you are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally prohibited from receiving or using the Service under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use our Service.


### 3. Who can use our Platform

We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the UPTOUS community.

### 6. Access to accounts and Affiliate Deals

Access to your account, created revenues and any affiliate deals or their information are only granted to you. Sharing of your account login credentials or the redistribution of affiliate links to third parties in an effort to undermine the process for the third party to create their own account with their own information will result in a termination of this agreement and in a permanent ban from our platform.


### 7. Communications

The entire communication with us is electronic. Every time you send us an email or visit our website, you are going to be communicating with us. You hereby consent to receive communications from us. If you subscribe to the news on our website, you are going to receive regular emails from us.

Payment will be wired to your bank account on a monthly basis. However, exact dates may vary. You can see the next possible day for your payout in the revenue section of the dashboard. It is your responsibility to provide us with the needed information about your bank account through the according form in your profile settings. Payments may be withheld in case of fraud detection. The exact amount to be wired to your bank account may vary from the amount stated in the dashboard as our platform operates with multiple currencies that will be converted to the currency of your location. The amount we calculate based on daily updated public exchange rates may be different from the ones our payment provider or your bank applies.
