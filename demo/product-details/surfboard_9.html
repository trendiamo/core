<p class="description">Introducing the Form High Line surfboard, a wave hungry all-rounder that absolutely flies!</p>
<br>
<p class="description">The High Line has all the curves and foam in the right places. The extra foam in the wider nose gets you in early and the stable nature just begs to be chucked around. The stubby nose elongates the rail line so you don't need to grab a mal or fun shape when the waves are small. </p>
