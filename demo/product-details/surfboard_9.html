<p class="description">Introducing the Form High Line surfboard, a wave hungry all-rounder that absolutely flies!</p>
<br>
<p class="description">The High Line has all the curves and foam in the right places. The extra foam in the wider nose gets you in early and the stable nature just begs to be chucked around. The stubby nose elongates the rail line so you don't need to grab a mal or fun shape when the waves are small. Once up and riding The High Line just takes off and its ability to maintain this speed is what makes it the perfect craft to get the most out of mediocre conditions and compete in busy line-ups. The outline and bottom contours (single to double with slight vee out the back) make for a smooth turning surfboard with a surprisingly tight radius that doesn't easily get bogged.</p>
