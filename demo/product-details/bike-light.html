<p class="description">This smart, weatherproof taillight has a lower-output (20 lumen) solid mode or a high-intensity 80-lumen flash setting that’s perfect for daytime.</p>
<br>
<p class="description">But that’s not all: an accelerometer detects braking or cornering and brightens to a 100-lumen solid-red beam to alert traffic behind you. It lasts 10 to 25 hours between recharges, and mounts vertically or horizontally.</p>
