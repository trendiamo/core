<img class="product-icons" alt="" src="img/Icons/img-tag-pdp.png" />
<p class="description">The Phipps One Bad Egg surfboard is a purists dream and simply oozes class. The beautiful clean lines of this performance egg make it an absolute must-have if you fancy taking on some big chunky waves or just fancy cruising some summer walls.</p>
<br>
<p class="description">Yeah you could find a shorter, wider summer ride but you won't find a better paddling surfboard that'll thrive in double overhead waves and still be a dream to ride when it's waist high and a bit mushy.</p>
<br>
<p class="description">This stunning surfboard comes with a 2+1 fin set up so you can experiment with a multitude of fin configurations. The One Bad Egg really paddles beautifully and delivers incredible drive especially with a good set of side fins and a smaller 6 or 7 inch fin in the box.</p>
