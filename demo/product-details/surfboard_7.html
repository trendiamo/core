<p class="description">The Slater Designs LFT Cymatic surfboard is going to set a new bench-mark for high-performance shortboards...FACT. There is already unprecedented levels of exited frothing from fans of Tommo and Kelly's previous creations and the Cymatic looks to have taken another huge stride towards the ultimate everyday shortboard for pros and Joes alike. </p>

<p class="description">Kelly told Stab about the Cymatic "The minimal amount of board to do the maximum amount of surfing. We chopped the nose off ahead of the rail line you need and went with a pretty wide bat tail (like the Sci-Fi model). With the added bite of the channels the tail still holds while giving plenty of lift. This edit (check the video below!!) is from one session at Haleiwa in January. I actually took the board there as a joke that day cause it was too big for what I thought it could handle. I got my best rides earlier that session but this edit gives you an idea. This is a four fin 5'3 x 18 5/8 x 2 5/16 with 25.5L. I don’t want to ride anything else right now and everyone who rides it wants to take it off my hands.</p>
