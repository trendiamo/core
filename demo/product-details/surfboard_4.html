<p class="description">​The Firewire Timbertek Greedy Beaver surfboard. The Greedy Beaver looks like a longboard, has all the benefits that a longboard brings but it’s a shortboard in spirit. It’s got the wave catching ability and the glide of a log but has the manoeuvrability you associate with a shortboard. You can put it on a rail and surf it off the tail and it comes to life like you can't believe, tight turns and pocket surfing are a reality on a board which looks like a longboard. All this is possible through the thinned out dropped rails and the single to double concave. The reduced volume in the rail allows you to start your turns more easily than you'd expect and the single to double concave gives the board lift which maintains the speed through fatter or flatter sections of the wave. Guaranteed fun in waves from knee to head high for all levels of surfer.</p>
