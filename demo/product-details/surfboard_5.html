<p class="description">The Firewire LFT Hydronaut has been in the pipeline (sorry) for a long, long time and after some rigorous testing and fine tuning has finally landed at the Boardshop warehouse.</p>
<br>
<p class="description">This is Daniel "Tomo" Thomson's first proper step-up designed for big powerful waves and barrels. Although already revered as a beast in barrelling beach-breaks, the long awaited Hydronaut is no one-trick-pony. According to the Firewire website the Hydronaut's ideal wave size would be 3 - 6 feet but this sounds a little limiting to us. Sized right this step-up will thrive in sizeable waves, perfect for Bali and the bigger days in the Maldives, right at home in the chunkier barrels of France and Portugal.</p>
