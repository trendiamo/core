<p class="description">You don't need to be an alternative surfer to ride this Twin Fin, as the way it has been designed allows the Bipolar Twin to sit perfectly alongside your short board range. The model suits a wide variety of surfers, from beginner to advanced, and is arguably one of the funnest boards in JR small wave range. The idea for the Bipolar Twin started right back when JR released the Sloth. </p>

<p class="description">After experiencing the natural speed and flow the Sloth boasts in below subpar conditions, JR knew he had to work on something more suited to when the conditions grew a little punchier. </p>
