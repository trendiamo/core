<p class="description">The Lost Psycho Killer surfboard looks set to be an absolute must-have for this coming summer season. A little more forgiving than its ridiculously addictive predecessor the Quiver Killer. The Psycho killer inherits all of the QK's design aspects; easy wave catching, versatility in a wide range of conditions and appealing to a very broad spectrum of abilities from team-rider to first-time shortboarder.</p>
<br>
<p class="description">The all-new Psycho Killer has been revamped with a fresh outline boasting a double-bump swallow tail which delivers more "pop" in smaller waves and added hold and control in more demanding conditions.</p>
